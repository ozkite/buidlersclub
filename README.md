## 🧱 What is Buidlers Club?

**Buidlers Club is not a platform. It’s a movement.**

A decentralized sanctuary for elite developers, cryptoeconomic designers, and visionary builders who ship code that liberates humanity. We reject bloated frameworks, empty talk, and permissioned innovation.

Instead, we offer:
- 🔥 **Real collaboration** with builders who ship
- 🌍 **Global hackathons & bootcamps** (IRL + virtual)
- 🧠 **Skill-matching** to find your missing co-buidler
- 🛠️ **Curated tech stacks**: SDKs, APIs, contracts, tooling
- 💎 **Perks**: Free infra credits (Vercel, Alchemy, etc.)
- 🏛️ **DAO-governed** funding for high-impact projects

> 💡 *You don’t need permission. You just need to ship.*

## 📜 The Rules of Buidlers Club

1. **You do not talk about the project's complexity.**
2. **YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT'S COMPLEXITY*
3. If someone says *“I’m shipping it,”* goes limp, or taps out—the build is over.
4. Two developers to a pair-programming session.
5. One core feature at a time, fellas.
6. No frameworks, no libraries—just pure code.
7. Coding will go on as long as it has to until the feature is complete.
8. **If this is your first night at Buidlers Club—you have to ship something new.**
