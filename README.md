## 📜 The Rules of Buidlers Club

1. You do not talk about the project's complexity.  
2. YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT'S COMPLEXITY!  
3. If someone says “I’m shipping it,” goes limp, or taps out—the build is over.  
4. Two developers to a pair-programming session.  
5. One core feature at a time, fellas.  
6. No frameworks, no libraries—just pure code.  
7. Coding will go on as long as it has to until the feature is complete.  
8. **If this is your first night at Buidlers Club—you have to ship something new.**
